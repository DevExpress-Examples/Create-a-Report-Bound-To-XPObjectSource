# Reporting for WinForms - How to Create a Report Bound to XPObjectSource

You can use [XPO](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/orm/) to retrieve data from a data source, and the **XPObjectSource** component to bind reports to this data. This example demonstrates how to use the **XPObjectSource** component in reports:

- You can use the [Report Wizard](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/4254) to [create the **XPObjectSource** component and bind a report to it at design time](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/400274).

- You can [create the **XPObjectSource** component and bind a report to it at runtime](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/400276).

- You can [provide a custom connection for the **XPObjectSource** component at runtime](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/400285).
