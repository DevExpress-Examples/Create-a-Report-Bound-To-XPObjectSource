# How to Create a Report Bound to XPObjectSource

You can use [XPO](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/orm/) to retrieve data from a data source in your reporting applications. DevExpress Reporting provides the **XPOBjectSource** component to bind reports to the XPO data. This example demonstrates several ways to use the **XPObjectSource** component in reports:

- You can [create the XPObjectSource component and bind a report to it at design time](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/400274). To do this, use the [Report Wizard](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/4254).

- You can [create the XPObjectSource component and bind a report to it dynamically](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/400276), in code.

- You can [provide a custom connection for the XPObjectSource component dynamically](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/400285), in code.
